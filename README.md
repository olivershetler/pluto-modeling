# README

This repository contains several models that forecast a proxy for lease renewal terms for rental buildings in New York City.

See [the article](./article.pdf) for details on the analysis.

The Jupyter Notebooks for each model are in the folder `./python/`. Saved models are in the folder `./models/`. Performance graphs are in the folder `./figs/`.

The data analyzed in this repository was assembled and re-engineered from NYC Open Data's [PLUTO dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page). You can find the re-engineered panel data set [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olivershetler/pluto). Additionally, you can find the details on how the data were assembled and re-coded in my other repository on this topic [here](https://github.com/olivershetler/pluto-database).
